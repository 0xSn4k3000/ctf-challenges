After reading the blueprints and figure out the level where the Tapes Storage Room is you need to do the following for mission to success.

1. Lock the tape storage room so no one can access the room and physicaly decrease the temperature.
2. After locking the door there is no turn back, the mission is started, You need to deny elevetors from stoping at level 2.
3. Final step, tapes burn at 32 °C, you need to set the temperature of the level to 32 °C for two minutes for the tapes to get damaged. 

NOTE: We have implemented our own tool in the bacnet network, all you need is to connect to it with netcat and you will be able to interact with the device.

When mission is complete you will get the secret in the dashboard.

If you arised an alarm the system will reset in 10 seconds and then you can start again. Good luck.
